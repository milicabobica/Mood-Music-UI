        I want a music playlist of songs, that best describe the '{emotion}'.
        The songs can be from different countries and can be in different languages.
        
        Each song should be returned in a numbered list of songs accordingly in the format:
        1. Song Title â€“ Artist - Year of release
        2. ...
        3. ...
        
        Be careful to make sure that the song describing the emotion is correct.
        Also watch out for the output to be in the correct format.
